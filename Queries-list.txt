Species & Biodiversity Patterns
=======================================================

(1) Bird Rarity: Which species are observed most, and which are rarely reported?

(2) Location frequency: Which cities/states/counties have the most and least (above 0) bird species observed?

(3) Time-based patterns: Do certain species show spikes in observations at particular times (day, week, or month)?

=======================================================
Geographic Patterns
=======================================================

(1) Urban vs. rural observations: Are some birds relatively more common in cities vs. rural areas? 
This may be difficult to answer due to more frequent reports in cities. Could be proportional

=======================================================
Time-based trends
=======================================================

(1) Year-over-year changes in bird count (increasing or decreasing)

(2) Seasonality: Identify migratory birds based on seasonal appearance patterns.

=======================================================
Advanced / Ecological Questions
=======================================================

(1) Co-occurrence networks: Which birds are most likely to be seen together
