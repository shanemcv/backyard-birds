(1) Writeup of architecture and design - include in README
Also go over what you didn't do
go through the process and make sure you get credit for anything 'good' in the application

(2) Include video of final project
Walk through and run examples

(3) Not a bad idea to leave webapp running (Spertus will give instructions on nohup or no process manager)
